Hunger
======

Django app to manage a private beta phase for a website.

- This app provides users with the change to sign up for a private beta - by providing their email address.
- The administrators of the website can manually invite people to join the beta from the Django admin panel.
- The signup view of the app is only accessible by providing the correct invitation code in the url.


Hunger has borrowed and modified a lot of code from:
